It is estimated that data scientists spend about 80% of their time finding 
and cleaning data. The data currently being produced is infinitely variable 
in its structure, presentation, and scale. The examples in these exercises 
presented deal with the infinite variety of data and how to interact with 
disparate sources of data. Topics include data structures and data management 
via Python, SQL, and other tools that show how to acquire, prepare, clean, and 
automate dataset creation. It would help to have a basic understanding of 
programming (Python) to understand the exercises.
